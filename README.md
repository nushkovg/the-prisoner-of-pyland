# The Prisoner of Pyland v1.0

* The Prisoner of Pyland is a short command line decision game created with Python3.6.
* It uses a small engine to run. The engine was created with the help of the Learn Python3 The Hard Way book by Zed Shaw.
* To run it, just make sure you have Python3.6 installed on your PC, it works on every operating system. Then type 'python3.6 tpp_main.py' in your command line or terminal and start playing. Also make sure you have the three .py files together in a single location.
* This is the first version, more of it will come soon. The plan is not to expand the game, but create a single wep app from it using Flask.
* If you find any bugs, or have ideas on how to simplify/expand the game, feel free to notify me, as it would help me learn more.

### Short story about the game:
* It's been too long since you've seen the sun shine. Your decision to dismiss the evil city ruler's request about creating that weapon of mass murder had you locked up in a dungeon. You have decided not to use your engineering skills for evil purposes, and this is your reward. You've had enough of this nonsense, so you decided to escape these dark dungeons to finally have your revenge. You must do it for yourself and for all of the people that are being tortured daily by that filthy ruler.
