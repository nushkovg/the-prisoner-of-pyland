# The Prisoner of Pyland v1.0

* The Prisoner of Pyland is a short command line decision game created with Python3.6.
* It uses a small engine to run. The engine was created with the help of the Learn Python3 The Hard Way book by Zed Shaw.

### Short story about the game:
* It's been too long since you've seen the sun shine. Your decision to dismiss the evil city ruler's request about creating that weapon of mass murder had you locked up in a dungeon. You have decided not to use your engineering skills for evil purposes, and this is your reward. You've had enough of this nonsense, so you decided to escape these dark dungeons to finally have your revenge. You must do it for yourself and for all of the people that are being tortured daily by that filthy ruler.

### How to use (Linux)
* Requires 'python' and 'pip' packages installed.
* To install the script, open your Terminal and first access the folder you downloaded and then process with the installation:
  ```
  cd Downloads/
  unzip the-prisoner-of-pyland-master.zip
  rm the-prisoner-of-pyland-master.zip
  cd the-prisoner-of-pyland-master/
  sudo python setup.py install
  ```
* To run it, just write this in your terminal:
  ```
  the-prisoner-of-pyland
  ```
* To uninstall, you need to have 'pip' installed:
  ```
  pip uninstall the-prisoner-of-pyland
  ```
* If you find any bugs, or have ideas on how to simplify/expand the game, feel free to notify me, as it would help me learn more.
